The snake consists of points. Every point has coordinates and a vector of movement. If some body's point is in turn point it changes its vector of movement. Keypress changes a vector of movement of head point and creates a point of turn for other points.

Menu architecture was finaly implemented. Snake object have to be moved into Game state object.
